## Data Overview
Cardiovascular disease is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels. And are the leading cause of death worldwide by representing 32% of all global deaths, which is important to detect cardiovascular disease as early as possible so that management with counselling and medicines can begin.
Through this project we want to build a model to predict the patient's condition based on many features related to the patient.


## Data Description
The dataset consists of 13 features and 70,000 observations.

Below is a description of the features: 

| Feature name  | Description   | Data type |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| id            | unique number | int64         |
| age           | patient's age in days| int64       |
| gender        | women or men  | int64         |
| height        | patient's height (cm)| int64         |
| weight        | patient's weight (kg)| float64       |
| ap_hi         | Systolic blood pressure | int64      |
| ap_lo         | Diastolic blood pressure | int64 |
| cholesterol   | Cholesterol level in the patient's body | int64 |
| gluc          | The patient's body glucose level | int64 |
| smoke         | patient smokes or not | int64 |
| alco          | Alcohol intake | int64 |
| active        | Physical activity | int64 |
| cardio        | Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease | int64 |


## Goals
- Build a classification model to predict the patient's condition.
- Choose the model that give us the best prediction.


## Questions
1. Does the age has any impact on Cardiovascular disease?

2. What is the sex most affected Cardiovascular disease?

3. Is the smoking a factor in infection with Cardiovascular disease?

4. Is the weight a factor in infection with Cardiovascular disease?


## Classification Algorithms

**On this dataset we used different methods of classification :**

- KNN models.
- Descion Tree model.
- Logistic regression model.
- Random forest model.
- Gradient boosting model.
- XGradient boosting model.
- Naive bayes model (NB).
- Support vector machain model (SVM).

## Tools
- Libraries: 
pandas, 
numpy, 
matplotlib, 
seaborn, 
plotly, 
sklearn.

- Softwares: 
GitHub, 
Jupyter,
Zoom,
